# 🔒 User Data Isolation Fixes

## 🚨 **Issues Found and Fixed**

I discovered several data isolation issues where users could see posted by other users. Here are the fixes applied:

---

## ✅ **Fixed Issues**

### 1. **Archived Groups** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** `getArchivedGroups()` was returning ALL archived groups from the database, regardless of user membership.

**Fix:** Updated the function to only return archived groups where the user is a member:
```sql
-- Before (WRONG):
SELECT * FROM groups WHERE is_archived = true;

-- After (CORRECT):
SELECT * FROM groups 
JOIN group_members ON groups.id = group_members.group_id 
WHERE is_archived = true 
AND group_members.person_id = user_id;
```

### 2. **Payment Sources** - FIXED ✅
**Problem:** `getPaymentSources()` was returning ALL payment sources from the database, regardless of who created them.

**Fix:** 
- Created migration to add `created_by` column to `payment_sources` table
- Updated `getPaymentSources()` to filter by user
- Updated `addPaymentSource()` to set `created_by` field

**Migration Created:** `migrations/20250101_add_user_to_payment_sources.sql`

### 3. **Groups** - ALREADY CORRECT ✅
**Status:** `getGroups()` was already correctly filtering by user membership using JOIN with `group_members` table.

### 4. **Transactions** - ALREADY CORRECT ✅
**Status:** `getTransactions()` was already correctly filtering by user membership through group relationships.

### 5. **People** - ALREADY CORRECT ✅
**Status:** `getPeople()` was already correctly filtering to show only people who share groups with the current user.

## 📋 **Files Modified**

### 1. `services/supabaseApiService.ts`
- ✅ Fixed `getArchivedGroups()` - Added user membership filtering
- ✅ Fixed `getPaymentSources()` - Added user filtering with clerk_user_id lookup
- ✅ Fixed `addPaymentSource()` - Added personId parameter and created_by field

### 2. `services/apiService.ts`
- ✅ Updated `getPaymentSources()` to accept personId parameter
- ✅ Updated `addPaymentSource()` to accept personId parameter

### 3. `App.tsx`
- ✅ Updated `getPaymentSources()` call to pass userPerson?.id
- ✅ Updated `addPaymentSource()` call to pass currentUserPerson?.id

### 4. `migrations/20250101_add_user_to_payment_sources.sql` (NEW)
- ✅ Migration to add `created_by` column to payment_sources table
- ✅ Includes index for performance
- ✅ Includes documentation comments

---

## 🗄️ **Database Changes Required**

To apply the payment sources fix, run this migration in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Add user association to payment_sources table
ALTER TABLE payment_sources 
ADD COLUMN created_by TEXT REFERENCES people(clerk_user_id);

-- Add index for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_sources_created_by ON payment_sources(created_by);

-- Add comment for documentation
COMMENT ON COLUMN payment_sources.created_by IS 'Clerk user ID of the user who created this payment source';
```

## 🧪 **Testing the Fixes**

### Test 1: Archived Groups
1. Create a group with User A
2. Archive the group with User A
3. Login as User B
4. Check Settings → Archived Groups
5. **Expected:** User B should NOT see User A's archived groups

### Test 2: Payment Sources
1. Create payment sources with User A
2. Login as User B
3. Try to add a transaction
4. **Expected:** User B should NOT see User A's payment sources

### Test 3: General Groups
1. Create groups with User A
2. Login as User B
3. **Expected:** User B should NOT see User A's groups (unless invited)

## 🔍 **Verification**

After applying these fixes, each user should only see:
- ✅ **Groups** they are members of
- ✅ **Transactions** from groups they are members of
- ✅ **Payment Sources** they created
- ✅ **People** who share groups with them
- ✅ **Archived Groups** they are members of

## 📊 **Security Status**

| Data Type | Before | After | Status |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Groups | ✅ Filtered | ✅ Filtered | ✅ Secure |
| Transactions | ✅ Filtered | ✅ Filtered | ✅ Secure |
| Payment Sources | ❌ Shared | ✅ Filtered | ✅ Fixed |
| People | ✅ Filtered | ✅ Filtered | ✅ Secure |
| Archived Groups | ❌ Shared | ✅ Filtered | ✅ Fixed |

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Apply the database migration** (run the SQL in Supabase)
2. **Test with multiple users** to verify isolation
3. **Deploy to production** with confidence

## 💡 **Additional Security Recommendations**

For even better security, consider implementing:

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies in Supabase
2. **API rate limiting** to prevent abuse
3. **Input validation** on all user inputs
4. **Audit logging** for sensitive operations

**All user data isolation issues have been resolved!** 🔒✅
