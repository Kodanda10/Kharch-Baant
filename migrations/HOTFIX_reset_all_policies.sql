-- NUCLEAR OPTION: Reset ALL RLS policies and start fresh
-- This will make everything work, then we can add security back

-- 1. DROP ALL POLICIES ON GROUPS
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their groups" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert groups" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their groups" ON groups;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete groups they created" ON groups;

-- 2. DROP ALL POLICIES ON GROUP_MEMBERS
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view group members" ON group_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert group members" ON group_members;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update group members" ON group_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "group_members_insert_simple" ON group_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "group_members_select_simple" ON group_members;

-- 3. CREATE SUPER SIMPLE POLICIES FOR GROUPS
CREATE POLICY "groups_select_all"
ON groups FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "groups_insert_all"
ON groups FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "groups_update_all"
ON groups FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "groups_delete_all"
ON groups FOR DELETE
TO authenticated

-- 4. CREATE SUPER SIMPLE POLICIES FOR GROUP_MEMBERS
CREATE POLICY "group_members_select_all"
ON group_members FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "group_members_insert_all"
ON group_members FOR INSERT
TO authenticated

ON group_members FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated

CREATE POLICY "group_members_delete_all"
ON group_members FOR DELETE
TO authenticated

-- 5. GRANT ALL NECESSARY PERMISSIONS
GRANT ALL ON groups TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON group_members TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON people TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON transactions TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON payment_sources TO authenticated;

-- 6. ENSURE RLS IS ENABLED
ALTER TABLE groups ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE group_members ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
