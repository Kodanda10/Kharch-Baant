## 📋 Current User Flow

### **1. User Authentication & Onboarding**

```
User visits app
  ↓
Supabase Auth check
  ↓
IF NOT authenticated → Show Login/Signup
  ↓
User signs up/logs in
  ↓
ensureUserExists() called
  ↓
User record created in 'people' table with clerk_user_id
  ↓
Welcome email sent (if configured)
  ↓
Redirect to main app
```

### **2. Group Creation Flow**

**Current Implementation:**

```typescript
// When user creates a group:
1. User clicks "Create Group" button
2. GroupFormModal opens
3. User enters:
   - Group name
   - Currency
   - Group type (trip, household, etc.)
   - Trip dates (if applicable)
   - Members to add
   
4. User clicks Save
5. addGroup() function called:
   - Insert group record into 'groups' table
   - Add members array + creator to 'group_members' table
   - Creator automatically included even if not in members list
   
6. Group appears in user's group list
```

**Key Code:**
```typescript
// services/supabaseApiService.ts - Line 165-169
const membersToAdd = [...groupData.members];
if (personId && !membersToAdd.includes(personId)) {
  membersToAdd.push(personId);
}
// Creator is always included as a member ✅
```

### **3. Group Visibility Flow**

**How Groups are Filtered:**

```typescript
// services/supabaseApiService.ts - Line 120-136
export const getGroups = async (personId?: string): Promise<Group[]> => {
  let query = supabase
    .from('groups')
    .select('*')
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });

  // If personId is provided, only return groups where the person is a member
  if (personId) {
    query = supabase
      .from('groups')
      .select(`
        *,
        group_members!inner(person_id)
      `)
      .eq('group_members.person_id', personId)  // ✅ FILTER BY MEMBERSHIP
      .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
  }

  const { data, error } = await query;
  // ...
}
```

**Logic:**
- ✅ Query uses `!inner` join - ONLY returns groups where user is in `group_members` table
- ✅ If user removes themselves, group should disappear
- ⚠️ **BUT THERE'S A BUG...**

## 🐛 BUG #1: Can See Group After Removing Self

### **Issue Description:**
User creates a group, removes themselves from the group, but can still see the group with no members.

### **Root Cause:**
The issue is in how the UI handles group updates after member removal.

**Problem Flow:**
1. User opens group edit modal
2. User removes themselves from members list
3. User clicks Save
4. `updateGroup()` is called
5. Members are deleted and re-inserted
6. **Local state is updated** but query filtering hasn't run yet
7. Group still appears in UI with stale data

### **Current Update Flow:**

```typescript
// App.tsx - Line 386-390
const updatedGroup = await api.updateGroup(editingGroup.id, groupData);
setGroups(prev => prev.map(g => 
    g.id === editingGroup.id ? updatedGroup : g  // ❌ Blindly updates
));
```

**Problem:** 
- State is updated with the modified group
- No re-fetch from database with proper filtering
- Group remains in local state even though user is no longer a member

### **Expected Behavior:**
After removing self from a group, the group should:
1. Disappear from the group list immediately
2. User should be redirected to home screen
3. Group should not be accessible anymore

### **Fix Required:**

**Option A (Recommended):** Re-fetch groups after update
```typescript
const handleSaveGroup = async (groupData: Omit<Group, 'id'>) => {
    try {
        if (editingGroup) {
            await api.updateGroup(editingGroup.id, groupData);
            
            // ✅ Re-fetch groups with proper filtering
            const updatedGroups = await api.getGroups(currentUserPerson?.id);
            setGroups(updatedGroups);
            
            // ✅ Check if user removed themselves
            const stillMember = groupData.members.includes(currentUserId);
            if (!stillMember) {
                // User removed themselves - go home
                setSelectedGroupId(null);
                alert('You have left the group.');
            }
        } else {
            // ... create new group
        }
        setIsGroupModalOpen(false);
        setEditingGroup(null);
    } catch (error) {
        // ... error handling
    }
};
```

**Option B:** Check membership and filter locally
```typescript
const updatedGroup = await api.updateGroup(editingGroup.id, groupData);

// Check if user is still a member
if (!groupData.members.includes(currentUserId)) {
    // User removed themselves - remove from state
    setGroups(prev => prev.filter(g => g.id !== editingGroup.id));
    setSelectedGroupId(null);
    alert('You have left the group.');
} else {
    // Still a member - update normally
    setGroups(prev => prev.map(g => 
        g.id === editingGroup.id ? updatedGroup : g
    ));
}
```

## 🐛 BUG #2: Creator Name Not Visible in Group

### **Issue Description:**
When a user creates a group, their name should appear in the members list so others can see who's in the group.

### **Current Status:**
✅ **ACTUALLY WORKING** - This is NOT a bug!

**Evidence:**
```typescript
// services/supabaseApiService.ts - Line 165-169
const membersToAdd = [...groupData.members];
if (personId && !membersToAdd.includes(personId)) {
  membersToAdd.push(personId);  // ✅ Creator IS added
}
```

**The creator IS added to the group members automatically.**

### **Possible User Confusion:**

**Scenario 1:** UI not showing creator's name
- Check if `transformDbGroupToAppGroup` properly loads all members
- Verify GroupView displays all members from the members array

**Scenario 2:** Creator not in "Add Members" section initially
- This is expected - creator adds other members, then is auto-included
- GroupFormModal shows currentMembers which includes creator after save

### **Verification Needed:**

1. **Check Member Display in GroupView:**
```typescript
// components/GroupView.tsx should show all group members
const groupMembers = people.filter(p => group.members.includes(p.id));
// Display groupMembers list in UI
```

2. **Check if transformDbGroupToAppGroup loads members correctly:**
```typescript
const transformDbGroupToAppGroup = async (dbGroup: DbGroup): Promise<Group> => {
  // ... should fetch all members from group_members table
  const members = await getGroupMembers(dbGroup.id);
  return {
    id: dbGroup.id,
    name: dbGroup.name,
    members: members.map(m => m.person_id),  // ✅ Should include creator
    // ...
  };
};
```

## 📊 Current Data Flow Summary

### **Group Creation:**
```
User creates group
  ↓
addGroup(groupData, currentUserPerson.id)
  ↓
Insert into 'groups' table
  ↓
Insert members + creator into 'group_members' table
  ↓
✅ Creator IS included as member
  ↓
Return group with all members
```

### **Group Retrieval:**
```
getGroups(currentUserPerson.id)
  ↓
SELECT * FROM groups
  INNER JOIN group_members ON group_id = groups.id
  WHERE group_members.person_id = currentUserPerson.id
  ↓
✅ Only returns groups where user is a member
  ↓
For each group, load all members from group_members
  ↓
✅ All members including creator visible
```

### **Group Update (Member Removal):**
```
updateGroup(groupId, groupData)
  ↓
Update group details
  ↓
DELETE all members from group_members
  ↓
INSERT new members list
  ↓
⚠️ Return updated group (no re-filtering)
  ↓
🐛 UI updates state without checking if user still member
  ↓
🐛 Group still visible even if user removed themselves
```

## ✅ Recommendations

### **Priority 1 (Critical):**
1. **Fix self-removal bug** - Implement Option A or B from Bug #1
2. **Add confirmation dialog** when user tries to remove themselves
3. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure group disappears after self-removal

### **Priority 2 (Enhancement):**
4. **Show creator badge** in member list for clarity
5. **Prevent removing last member** - Group must have at least 1 member
6. **Add loading state** during group updates

### **Priority 3 (User Experience):**
7. **Show member count** in group cards
8. **Display "You" next to current user's name** in member lists
9. **Add tooltips** explaining member management

---

## 🧪 Test Cases

### **Test Case 1: Self-Removal**
```
1. Create a new group
2. Add 2 other members
3. Save group
4. Edit group
5. Remove yourself from members
6. Save group
EXPECTED: Group disappears from list, redirected to home
ACTUAL: Group still visible with no members (BUG)
```

### **Test Case 2: Creator Visibility**
```
1. Create a new group
2. Don't add any other members
3. Save group
4. View group details
EXPECTED: Your name appears in members list
ACTUAL: (Need to verify - likely working)
```

### **Test Case 3: Group Filtering**
```
1. User A creates group
2. User B joins via invite
3. User A removes User B
4. User B refreshes app
EXPECTED: Group no longer visible to User B
ACTUAL: (Should work - query uses INNER JOIN)
```

## 💡 Additional Notes

### **Why the Bug Exists:**
The bug happens because of an optimization attempt - instead of re-fetching all groups from the database after an update, the code just updates the local state. This is faster but doesn't account for cases where the user should no longer see the group.

### **Trade-offs:**
- **Option A (Re-fetch):** Slower but guaranteed correct
- **Option B (Local filter):** Faster but needs careful logic

**Recommendation:** Use Option A for simplicity and correctness. Performance difference is negligible for group updates (which are infrequent).
