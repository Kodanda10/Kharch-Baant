# URGENT: Clerk Domain Whitelisting Required

## Status:
✅ Environment variables ARE being embedded in Vercel build
❌ App still shows blank screen

## Root Cause:
**Clerk is blocking your Vercel domain** because it's not whitelisted in Clerk dashboard.

## Fix Now:

### 1. Go to Clerk Dashboard
Visit: https://dashboard.clerk.com/

### 2. Sign in and select your application
Look for your application (should be "wanted-lynx-7" or similar)

### 3. Go to "Domains" Settings
**Left sidebar** → Click **"Domains"** or **"API Keys"**

### 4. Find "Allowed Origins" or "Frontend API"
Look for section called:
- "Allowed origins (CORS)" OR
- "Frontend API URLs" OR
- "Authorized domains"

### 5. Add Your Vercel Domain
Click "Add domain" or "Add origin" button

Add these URLs (add each one separately):
```
https://kharch-baant-psi.vercel.app
https://*.vercel.app
```

### 6. Save Changes
Click "Save" or "Add"

### 7. Wait 2-3 Minutes
Clerk needs time to propagate the domain whitelist

### 8. Test Again
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Visit your Vercel app
- Should now work!

## Why This Is The Issue:

Your Vercel build logs show:
```
[VITE] process.env.VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY: true ✅
[VITE] process.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL: true ✅
```

This means **environment variables are working**. But when the browser tries to connect to Clerk from your Vercel domain, Clerk **blocks it** because the domain isn't authorized.

## Alternative: Enable Development Mode

If you can't find the domain settings:

1. In Clerk Dashboard
2. Go to Settings or Configuration
3. Look for "Development mode" or "Testing mode"
4. Enable it temporarily (this disables domain restrictions)

## How to Verify It's a CORS Issue:

In your browser console (F12), you'll likely see errors like:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://wanted-lynx-7.clerk.accounts.dev/...' from origin 'https://kharch-baant-psi.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

This confirms Clerk is blocking the domain.

## After Adding Domain:

Your app should load with Clerk's login screen, and you'll be able to:
- ✅ Sign in with Google
- ✅ Create groups
- ✅ Use all features

---

**This is 100% a Clerk domain whitelist issue.** The build is working correctly now.
